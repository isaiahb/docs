# Getting Connected: Authentication Flow

Let's follow a user named Alex as they open the MentraOS mobile app and connect their smart glasses to the cloud. This journey shows how authentication works and how WebSocket connections are established.

## Step 1: Mobile App Login

When Alex opens the MentraOS app on their phone:

1. **User Authentication**
   - Alex logs in with their email/password
   - The app authenticates with our auth service
   - App receives a `coreToken` (JWT) that identifies Alex

2. **What's in the coreToken?**
   ```json
   {
     "sub": "alex@example.com",  // User's email
     "exp": 1234567890,          // Expiration time
     "iat": 1234567800           // Issued at time
   }
   ```

## Step 2: Glasses Connect via Phone

Once authenticated, the mobile app:

1. **Establishes Bluetooth connection** with Alex's smart glasses
2. **Opens WebSocket to cloud** at `wss://cloud.mentraos.com/glasses-ws`
3. **Sends the coreToken** in the Authorization header:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...
   ```

## Step 3: WebSocket Handshake

Now the magic happens in our cloud:

### 1. Connection Arrives at WebSocketService

```typescript
// In WebSocketService.ts
app.ws('/glasses-ws', (ws, req) => {
  // Extract and verify the JWT token
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);
  const userEmail = decoded.sub;
  
  // Hand off to GlassesWebSocketService
  glassesWebSocketService.handleConnection(ws, userEmail);
});
```

### 2. GlassesWebSocketService Takes Over

```typescript
// In GlassesWebSocketService.ts
handleConnection(ws: WebSocket, userEmail: string) {
  // Send connection acknowledgment
  ws.send(JSON.stringify({
    type: 'CONNECTION_ACK',
    sessionId: generateSessionId()
  }));
  
  // Create or retrieve UserSession
  let session = SessionStorage.getSession(userEmail);
  if (!session) {
    session = new UserSession(userEmail, ws);
    SessionStorage.addSession(session);
  } else {
    // Reconnection - update WebSocket
    session.updateWebSocket(ws);
  }
}
```

### 3. The First Message Exchange

Mobile app must send CONNECTION_INIT within 30 seconds:

```typescript
// From mobile app
{
  type: "CONNECTION_INIT",
  capabilities: {
    hasDisplay: true,
    hasSpeaker: true,
    hasMicrophone: true,
    hasCamera: true,
    hasNotificationAccess: true
  },
  version: "1.0.0",
  deviceModel: "MentraOS Live"
}
```

Cloud responds with CONNECTION_ACK:

```typescript
// From cloud
{
  type: "CONNECTION_ACK",
  capabilities: { /* echo back */ },
  settings: { /* user settings */ }
}
```

## Step 4: Heartbeat Keeps Connection Alive

Every 10 seconds, the cloud sends a ping to check if the connection is alive:

```typescript
// In UserSession.ts
private startHeartbeat() {
  this.heartbeatInterval = setInterval(() => {
    if (this.websocket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
      this.websocket.ping();
    }
  }, 10000);
}
```

If the mobile app doesn't respond to pings, the connection is considered dead and cleaned up.

## Step 5: Handling Reconnections

What happens when Alex's phone loses connection?

1. **Grace Period** (30 seconds)
   - UserSession remains in memory
   - Apps stay in "resurrecting" state
   - No data is lost

2. **Reconnection Within Grace Period**
   - Same coreToken is used
   - UserSession is retrieved from SessionStorage
   - WebSocket is updated with new connection
   - Apps are notified of reconnection
   - Everything continues seamlessly

3. **Reconnection After Grace Period**
   - New UserSession is created
   - Apps must be restarted
   - Previous state is lost

## Security Considerations

1. **JWT Validation**
   - All tokens are verified for signature
   - Expired tokens are rejected
   - Invalid tokens result in CONNECTION_ERROR

2. **User Isolation**
   - Each UserSession is keyed by email
   - No cross-user data access
   - Sessions are completely isolated

3. **Connection Limits**
   - One active glasses connection per user
   - New connections replace old ones
   - Prevents connection flooding

## Common Connection Errors

```typescript
// Connection rejected - invalid token
{
  type: "CONNECTION_ERROR",
  error: "Invalid authentication token"
}

// Connection rejected - expired token
{
  type: "CONNECTION_ERROR", 
  error: "Token expired"
}

// Connection timeout - no CONNECTION_INIT
{
  type: "CONNECTION_ERROR",
  error: "Connection initialization timeout"
}
```

## What's Next?

Now that Alex is connected, the cloud creates a UserSession for them. This session is their personal command center in the cloud. Let's explore [UserSessions](./3-user-sessions.md) next!
